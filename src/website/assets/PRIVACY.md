## What & Why

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services.

_Account information._ We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan and set up two-factor authentication (such as your name, email address, phone number, payment info and physical address).

_Your Stuff_. Our Services are designed as a simple and personalised way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages and so on (“**Your Stuff**”), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that possible, we store, process and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This related information includes your [profile information](/help/63), which makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators and usage activity.

_Contacts._ You can choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we’ll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.

_Usage information_. We collect information relating to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (such as sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders). We use this information to provide, improve and promote our Services, and protect Dropbox users. Please refer to our [FAQ](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq) for more information about how we use this usage information.

_Device information_. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.

_Cookies and other technologies_. We use technologies such as [cookies and pixel tags](/terms/cookies) to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we’ll respond to that signal as outlined [here](/terms/cookies). We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote Dropbox services. You can find out more about how cookies and similar technologies work, as well as how to opt out of the use of them for advertising purposes, [here](/terms/cookies).

_Marketing_. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you don’t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the [Notifications](/account/notifications) section of your personal account.

We sometimes contact people who don’t have a Dropbox account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before getting in touch. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by Dropbox, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.

_Bases for processing your data._ We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent that we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require our partners to obtain such consent. For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our [FAQ](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq).

For more details on the categories of personal information that are included in the information above, please see our [FAQ](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq).

## With whom

We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.

_Others working for and with Dropbox_. Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we use to process your personal data and more details on the categories of personal information that we’ve disclosed, please see our [FAQ](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq).

_Other Dropbox Companies_. Dropbox shares infrastructure, systems and technology with other Dropbox Companies to provide, improve, protect and promote Dropbox Company Services. We process your information across the Dropbox Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For more information on Dropbox Companies, Dropbox Company Services and how your data is used, please see our [FAQ](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq).

_Other users_. Our Services display information such as your name, profile picture, device, email address and usage information to other users you collaborate with or choose to share with. When you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organisation, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information – such as your name, team name, profile picture and email address – visible to other users in the same domain. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.

Certain features let you make additional information available to others.

_Other applications_. You can choose to connect your Dropbox account with third-party services – for example, via [Dropbox APIs](/developers). By doing so, you’re enabling Dropbox and those third parties to exchange information about you and data in your account so that Dropbox and those third parties can provide, improve, protect and promote their services. Please remember that third parties’ use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.

_Business Team admins_. If you are a user of a Dropbox Business team (collectively “Dropbox Business Team”), your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox Business Team account. Please refer to your organisation’s internal policies if you have questions about this. If you aren’t a Dropbox Business Team user but interact with a Dropbox Business Team user (for example, by joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organisation may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction. If you share Your Stuff with a Dropbox team user, the administrator of the team account may have the ability to access and edit what you share.

_Law & order and the public interest._ We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily harm; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users; (d) protect Dropbox’s rights, property, safety or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our Services or on your home computer’s hard drive. We’ll abide by the following [Government Request Principles](/transparency) when receiving, scrutinising and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:

*   Be transparent
*   Fight blanket requests
*   Protect all users and
*   Provide trusted services.

We publish a [Transparency Report](/transparency/reports) as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage you to review our [Government Request Principles](/transparency) and [Transparency Report](/transparency) for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.

## How

_Security_. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behaviour and content that may harm our Services, you or other users.

_User controls_. You can access, amend, download and delete your personal information by logging in to your Dropbox account and going to your [account settings page](/account). Find out more [here](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/access-personal-information) about managing your account information generally, or click [here](https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/settings-sign-in/change-profile-information) to see how to change your [profile information](/help/63).

_Retention_. When you sign up for an account with us, we’ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account exists or for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we’ll initiate deletion of this information after 30 days. Find out more [here](https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/restore-delete/data-retention-policy). Please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and backup storage, and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.

## Where

_Around the world_. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit data in the United States and locations around the world – including those outside your country. Data may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.

_EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield_. When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, Dropbox relies on a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with our customers and affiliates. Dropbox complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States. Dropbox has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. You can find Dropbox’s Privacy Shield certification [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list). You can also find out more about Privacy Shield at [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov).

Dropbox is overseen by the US Federal Trade Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organisation responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield compliance – free of charge to you. Please submit any such complaints directly to us first of all via [privacy@dropbox.com](mailto:privacy@dropbox.com). If you aren’t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at [https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield). In the event that your concern still isn’t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its principles.

You have control over your personal data and how it’s collected, used and shared. For example, you can:

*   _Delete Your Stuff in your Dropbox account_. You can find out more about how to delete files saved on Dropbox [here](https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/restore-delete/delete-files).

You can also ask us for a copy of personal data you provided to us or that we’ve collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting it, the types of sources we got it from, and types of third parties we’ve shared it with.
*   _Object to the processing of your personal data_. Depending on the processing activity, you can request that we stop or limit processing of your personal data.

If you are a Dropbox Business or Education customer outside North America, Dropbox acts as a processor of your data.

## Changes

If we’re involved in a reorganisation, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your data may be transferred as part of that deal. We’ll notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
