## üìù To-Do

This file sharing service is in a continuous state of development. New features/updates may come at any time. Some pending ideas are:

  * Make sure all context menu features work (including multi-select).
  * Create download feature allowing people to download folders + multiply item.
  * Functional drop down search filters.
  * Proper terms of service/privacy policy.
  * Files are encypted on the backend, to make sure everything is secure.
  * When a file is deleted, it's moved to trash for 7 days before actually deleted from system. (delete should probs be renamed to "move to trash")
  * Show proper upload progress bar.
